# Campus-Credit-Lending-and-Selling-System
We used the blockchain technology and smart contracts to achieve the records of loans between students, returns and credit, and also provide the sales services required by students with specific needs.  
- To a certain extent, we try to solve the problem of dishonesty in borrowing on campus, and feedback the integrity assessment to the users and the school. And the mini program could regulate the borrowing and lending behavior between students and give relevant protection.
- At the same time, it provides a platform for campus students to sell items, improve the spread of idle and demand information, and realize the demand and response.
